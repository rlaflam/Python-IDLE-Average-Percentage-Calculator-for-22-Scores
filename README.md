# Python-IDLE-Average-Percentage-Calculator-for-22-Scores
At the end of my college program, I wanted a quick way to calculate my average percentage after completing 22 different classes.

If you would like to change my Python source code to suit your needs, simply change the line that states "for i in range(22):". You can change the number "22" to any number of percentages you would like to calculate. 

This is a very simple tkinter canvas with simple colors and font. If you're taking a class on Python for beginners, this would be a great template to practice and modify. I hope you enjoy!
